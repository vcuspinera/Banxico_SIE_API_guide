## Token instructions
The first step to retrieve information from SIE API, is to get a Bmx-Token. 

You can request a 64-alphanumeric token in [this link](https://www.banxico.org.mx/SieAPIRest/service/v1/token?locale=en), which would be required to use the API. It would be quick and easy, just follow the instructions.

Finally, replace the string _"paste_here_your_token_(cell_B1)"_ located in the `SIE_Token.csv` file at this directory, with your token.
